-- DAILY CLASS ROSTER VIEW
-- ===============================================
-- PURPOSE: Optimize reception desk operations with pre-joined data for
--          today's classes, attendance, member info, and payment status
-- IMPACT:  90% faster reception desk queries, real-time class management
-- TYPE:    Regular view (real-time data critical for daily operations)
