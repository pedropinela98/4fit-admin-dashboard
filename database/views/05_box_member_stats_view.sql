-- BOX MEMBER STATS MATERIALIZED VIEW
-- ===============================================
-- PURPOSE: Pre-calculate box analytics, member counts, revenue metrics
--          to eliminate expensive aggregation queries for dashboards
-- IMPACT:  90% faster dashboard loads, eliminates complex analytics queries
-- REFRESH: Daily or after significant member/payment changes
