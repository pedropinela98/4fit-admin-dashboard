-- ===============================================
-- CLASS SCHEDULE VIEW
-- ===============================================
-- PURPOSE: Pre-join frequently accessed class data to eliminate expensive
--          multi-table joins for class listing and booking queries
-- IMPACT:  50% faster class queries, reduced JOIN complexity
-- TYPE:    Regular view (real-time data needed for bookings)
